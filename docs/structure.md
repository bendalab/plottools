# How to structure your code

Here we provide some best-practice tips on how to structure your code
for figures, such that

- others, including your future self, are able to simply modify your figures ,
- plot appearance can be changed quickly from a central module,
- it makes fun to improve your plots.


## File organization

From our general [guidelines] we already get some hints on how to organize the scripts
generating the figures:

1. Each figure is generated by a single python script.
2. The basename of the generated figure is the same as the one of the python script generating it.
3. The python script only generates the figure, it does not do any heavy computations.
4. Have a single central python module that defines basic figure appearance.

Let's assume we need three figures that we call `basicdata`,
`methods`, and `coolresult`.  Then for each of the figures we will
have a separate python script (1.)  with the respective name (2.). In
addition, we will have a script defining the appearance of the figures
that will be imported by all of the scripts generating the actual
figures. Let's call that script `plotstyle.py`.

We keep the file hierarchy flat and simply have four files in our working directory:
```  txt
+-- plotstyle.py
+-- basicdata.py
+-- methods.py
+-- coolresult.py
```

We discuss te content of the `plotstyle.py` module below, for now we
assume that it provides a single function `plot_style()`:
```py
def plot_style():
  pass
```

## Plotting scripts

So how to write an actual script generating a figure?

Let's start simple with a script `basicdata.py` generating a figure
with just a single panel (subplot). What do we need for this?

First of all we need the usual includes of `numpy` and `pandas` as
required, of `matplotlib` and of course the `plot_style()` function
from our central `plotstyle.py` module:
```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from plotstyle import plot_style
```

Following good python style we have at the bottom of the file the
following few lines:
```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
   plot_style()
   basicdata_figure()
```
that set up the plot appearance via our `plot_style()` function and
call the function `plot_basicdata()` that actually generates the
figure.  To keep the complexity of function names low, this function
carries the same name as the script it resides in, with `_figure`
appended to indicate that it actually generates a figure. Feel free to
use another sensible naming scheme.
