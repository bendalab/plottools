# LaTeX fonts

The default computern modern LaTeX font looks nice but has severla
drawbacks that have been overcom in recent years. You definitely want
to load a different font in your LaTeX preamble.

In particular for presentations you also might want to use a
sans-serif font with good support of sans-serif math typesetting.

The first adress to look at for choosing a font is the TUG font
catalogue: https://tug.org/FontCatalogue

Good typesetting style also uses fonts matching the main text font in
generated figures. matplotlib supports this by allowing to use LaTeX
directly for typesetting all text elements in a plot.

With the demos provided in this directory we explore LaTeX fonts for
their usage within matplotlib plots.
