\subsection{SIunits in normal text}

I do not drive faster than 100\,\kilo\meter\per\hour{} and small
things are measured in multiples of 12\,\micro\meter{} usually. Water
conductivity has a weired unit. In the tropics we measured
7.5\,\micro\siemens\per\centi\meter, but sometimes up to
253\,\micro\siemens\per\centi\meter. Important for electronics is the
resistance. You may measure 10\,\kilo\ohm. Or the resistivity as a
material constant, for example silicon has a resistivity of
2.3\,\kilo\ohm\meter. Another common quantity with an intersting unit
is of course the temperature. In my room I currently have
21\,\celsius.

\ohm{} --- $\ohm$ : $\Omega$ --- $\mathrm{\Omega}$ --- $\mathsf{\Omega}$ ---

\micro{} --- $\micro$ : $\mu$ --- $\mathrm{\mu}$ --- $\mathsf{\mu}$ ---
\ifcsname textmu\endcsname\textmu\fi --- \ifcsname textmicro\endcsname\textmicro\fi

\subsection{SIunits in math mode}

Some inline pythagoras equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and units
$12.34\,\micro\siemens\per\centi\meter$ about water
conductivities.

\[ U = 20 \times 20\,\mega\ohm{}\cdot 50\,\text{mA} \]

\[ v = 123.45 \frac{30\,\micro\meter}{10\,\text{ms}} \]

\[ {\cal F}[X](\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \sum_{k=1}^m \alpha_k\beta\gamma\delta\sin(2\pi f t)\,dt\,. \]
