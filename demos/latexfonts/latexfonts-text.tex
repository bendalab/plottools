I do not drive faster than 100\,km/h and small things are measured in
multiples of 12\,nm usually. Water conductivity has a weired unit. In
the tropics we measured 0.01\,mS/cm, but sometimes up to
0.25\,mS/cm. A common quantity with an intersting unit is of course
the temperature. In my room I currently have 21\,$^{\circ}$.

\subsection{Math mode}

Some inline pythagoras equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and this $e^{-x^2/2}$ is a Gaussian.

\[ {\cal F}[X](\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \sum_{k=1}^m \alpha_k\beta\gamma\delta\sin(2\pi f t)\,dt\,. \]
